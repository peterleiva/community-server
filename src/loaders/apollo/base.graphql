An *Post* is an user-submitted message enclosed into a block containing the
user's details and the date and time it was submitted. Posts are contained in
threads, where they appear as blocks one after another. The first post starts
the thread; this may be called the OP (original post). Posts that follow in
the thread are meant to continue discussion about that post, or respond to
other replies; it is not uncommon for discussions to be derailed.
